![LeetCode Stats](https://leetcode.card.workers.dev/aliam?theme=unicorn&font=source_code_pro)

A collection of solutions to Leetcode problems, all in Kotlin language. Mix of EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD questions. Problems are named `xxxx-problem-name-in-lowercase.kt`, for example [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/) is named `0071-simplify-path.kt`. Usually all problems are solved in the most efficient way, but some problems contains several and different solutions, in the same file but clearly separated.

(Interesting problems found on Lintcode but not on Leetcode have its own folder)

***If you have a better solution for a problem, any optimization, another way of solving it, etc, I would love to hear from you. Open a Issue or PR.***
