# Leetcode problem solutions in Kotlin

A collection of solutions to Leetcode problems, all in Kotlin language. Mix of EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD questions. Problems are named `xxxx-problem-name-in-lowercase.kt`, for example [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/) is named `0071-simplify-path.kt`. Usually all problems are solved in the most efficient way, but some problems contains several and different solutions, in the same file but clearly separated.

(Interesting problems found on Lintcode but not on Leetcode have its own folder)

I hope this repo will help you if you are looking for a specific solution to a problem in Kotlin. If you have a better solution for a problem, any optimization, another way of solving it, etc,  and would like to help, please do suggest it in issues or do a pull request.

Thank you for looking by.
