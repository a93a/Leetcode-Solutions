# Leetcode problem solutions in Kotlin

Mix of easy, medium and hard questions. Playground to learn more and to try to become a better code and improve my skills. Some were easy to solve, some I did solve but found better solution for it, some I kind of solved or was close to, but had to find help online to solve it, and some were impossible for me to solve.

I hope this repo will help you if you are looking for a specific solution to a problem in Kotlin. I named the files with the question/problem name so it would be easier to find. If you have a better solution for a problem, and would like to help, please do suggest it in issues or do a pull request. 

Thank you for looking by.
